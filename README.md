# Breast Cancer Analysis with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project performs breast cancer analysis using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features like texture, area, smoothness, and concavity. We use machine learning to build a model that classifies the tumor as benign or malignant.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is from the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set** from Kaggle. It contains features computed from digitized images of a breast mass and the diagnosis (M for malignant, B for benign).

- Data can be accessed from Kaggle: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
